Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) Split Stack
================================

This is a fork of the 3.1 release with the Split Stack code from my group project with zakird and zrenner.

This is an 64bit LLVM version of what is described in section 3 of this paper: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=194F16EA6366CE9747425661F27C8496?doi=10.1.1.13.7372&rep=rep1&type=pdf
